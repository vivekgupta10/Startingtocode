                Mahatma Gandhi was a great man of an unbelievably great
                personality. He certainly does not need anyone like me praising him. Furthermore, his efforts for Indian
                independence are unparalleled. Most noteworthy, there would have been a significant delay in
                independence without him. Consequently, the British because of his pressure left India in 1947. In this
                essay on Mahatma Gandhi, we will see his contribution and legacy.
                public figure. His role in social and political reform was
                instrumental. Above all, he rid the society of these social evils. Hence, many oppressed people felt
                great relief because of his efforts. Gandhi became a famous international figure because of these
                efforts. Furthermore, he became the topic of discussion in many international media outlets.
                Mahatma Gandhi made significant contributions to environmental sustainability. Most noteworthy, he said
                that each person should consume according to his needs. The main question that he raised was how much
                should a person consume?. Gandhi certainly put forward this question.
                Furthermore, this model of sustainability by Gandhi holds huge relevance in current India. This is
                because currently, India has a very high population. There has been the promotion of renewable energy
                and small-scale irrigation systems. This was due to Gandhiji's campaigns against excessive industrial
                development. Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence is probably his most important contribution.
                This philosophy of non-violence is known as Ahimsa. Most noteworthy, Gandhiji's aim was to seek
                independence without violence. He decided to quit the Non-cooperation movement after the Chauri-Chaura
                incident. This was due to the violence at the Chauri Chaura incident. Consequently, many became upset at
                this decision.
                However, Gandhi was relentless in his philosophy of Ahimsa.Secularism is yet another contribution of
                Gandhi. His belief was that no religion should have a monopoly
                on the truth. Mahatma Gandhi certainly encouraged friendship between different religions.Get the huge
                list of more than 500 Essay Topics and Ideas.Legacy of Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi has influenced
                many international leaders around the world. His struggle certainly became
                an inspiration for leaders. Such leaders are Martin Luther King Jr., James Beve, and James Lawson.
                Furthermore, Gandhi influenced Nelson Mandela for his freedom struggle. Also, Lanza del Vasto came to
                India to live with Gandhi.The United Nations has greatly honored Mahatma Gandhi. UN has made 2nd October
                as"The International Day
                of Nonviolence."Furthermore, many countries observe 30th January as School Day of Nonviolence and Peace.
                The awards given to Mahatma Gandhi are too many to discuss. Probably only a few nations remain which
                have not awarded Mahatma Gandhi. In conclusion, Mahatma Gandhi was one of the greatest political icons
                ever.
                Most noteworthy, Indians revere by describing him as the "father of the nation". His name will certainly
                remain immortal for all generations.
